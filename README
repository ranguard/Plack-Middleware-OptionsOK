NAME
         Plack::Middleware::OptionsOK

SYNOPSIS
         # in app.psgi
         use Plack::Builder;

         my $app = sub { ... } # as usual

         builder {
             enable "Plack::Middleware::OptionsOK";
             $app;
         };

DESCRIPTION
       Many reverse Proxy servers (such as Perlbal) use an 'OPTIONS *' request
       to confirm if a server is running.

       This middleware will respond with a '200' to this request so you do not
       have to handle it in your app. There will be no further processing
       after this
